# House Price Prediction Report

## Data Source
The house price data used in this project is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/xbwei).

## Problem
The objective of this project was to predict house prices based on various features, such as house area, types, zip code, and other relevant attributes.

## Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning process, I removed features with missing values and also excluded the ID feature from the model training as it was not relevant to predicting house prices.

## Training
For training the model, I used the default quick build approach, which automatically handles the selection of the model and training process.

## Performance
The model achieved an RÂ² score of 70%, indicating a moderate level of accuracy in predicting house prices. The model is able to predict new prices when changes are made to features like house type or size.
